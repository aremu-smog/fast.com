# Overview

This repo contains sample code for my talk at DevFest Ogbomosho, 2022 on "Code is Poetry: Building your first Google Chrome extension"

## How it works

- This branch (i.e main) contains a boilerplate to ensure I don't waste time during the talk carrying out redundant tasks like creating files and all.
- If you will like to see the complete code, check the `demo` branch
